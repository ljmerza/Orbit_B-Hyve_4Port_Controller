# Orbit B-Hyve XD 4-Port Bluetooth Sprinkler Controller

**Local BLE control for the Orbit B-Hyve XD Bluetooth hose timer — no cloud, no app, no Wi-Fi hub.**

> **STATUS:** All 4 zones controllable from Home Assistant. Custom AES encryption decoded, frame trailer checksum algorithm reverse-engineered.

| | |
|---|---|
| Device | Orbit B-Hyve XD Bluetooth Hose Faucet Timer |
| Part Number | 24634 |
| FCC ID | ML6-HT34BT |
| Firmware Tested | 0107 |
| Hardware | HT34A-0001 |
| Protocol | BLE GATT, AES-128 (custom CTR mode), CRC-16 CCITT inner, 16-bit sum trailer |

> ⚠️ **DO NOT UPDATE YOUR B-HYVE DEVICE FIRMWARE.** This integration was reverse-engineered against firmware 0107. A firmware update could change the encryption protocol or trailer algorithm and break compatibility. If the official B-Hyve app prompts you to update, **decline it.**

## What This Project Provides

- **Home Assistant custom integration** (`custom_components/orbit_bhyve_ble/`) — auto-discovers B-Hyve devices via Bluetooth, exposes one HA switch entity per zone, supports configurable per-zone watering durations.
- **Standalone Python CLI** (`scripts/bhyve.py`) — interactive setup wizard, network key extraction (via Orbit cloud API), and direct zone on/off control without HA.
- **MQTT bridge** (`scripts/bhyve_mqtt_bridge.py`) — for setups that prefer to expose B-Hyve as MQTT switches rather than via the HA integration.
- **Reverse-engineering documentation** — the full BLE protocol, AES algorithm, frame format, trailer checksum derivation, and protobuf schema, in `docs/`.
- **Exploration scripts** (`scripts/exploration/`) — the probes and tests that were used to discover the protocol.

## Installation

You can install the Home Assistant integration two ways. Pick the one that matches your setup.

### Option A: HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations → ⋮ menu → Custom repositories**.
2. Add this repository's URL with category **Integration**.
3. Click **Install** on **Orbit B-Hyve BLE Sprinkler**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE Sprinkler"**.

### Option B: Manual ZIP install

1. Download `orbit_bhyve_ble-X.Y.Z.zip` from the [Releases page](../../releases).
2. Unzip into your Home Assistant config directory so that the path is:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/orbit_bhyve_ble/__init__.py
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE Sprinkler"**.

### Configuration

The integration prompts for:

- **BLE MAC address** — populated automatically if HA's Bluetooth integration has already discovered the device.
- **Network key** — 32 hex characters (16 bytes). To extract this from your account, run the included setup wizard:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  pip install -r ../requirements.txt
  python3 bhyve.py setup
  ```
  See [`docs/network_key_extraction.md`](docs/network_key_extraction.md) for alternative extraction methods (ADB / MMKV).
- **Number of zones** — 1, 2, or 4 (the XD comes in 1, 2, and 4-port variants).

## Quick Start (CLI, no Home Assistant)

```bash
pip install bleak cryptography requests
python3 scripts/bhyve.py setup            # Interactive setup wizard
python3 scripts/bhyve.py on 1 300         # Zone 1 on for 5 minutes
python3 scripts/bhyve.py on 3 600         # Zone 3 on for 10 minutes
python3 scripts/bhyve.py off              # Stop all watering
```
